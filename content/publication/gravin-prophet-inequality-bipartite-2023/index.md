abstract: "We consider the Bayesian online selection problem of a matching in bipartite
  graphs, that is, the weighted online matching problem where the edges arrive online
  and edge weights are generated from a known distribution. This setting corresponds
  to the intersection of two matroids in the work of Kleinberg and Weinberg [ 40 ]
  and Feldman et al. [ 27 ]. We study a simple class of nonadaptive policies that
  we call vertex-additive policies. A vertex-additive policy assigns static prices
  to every vertex in the graph and accepts only those edges whose weight exceeds the
  sum of the prices on the edge endpoints. We show that there exists a vertex-additive
  policy with the expected payoff of at least one-third of the prophet's payoff and
  present a gradient descent algorithm that quickly converges to the desired vector
  of vertex prices. Our results improve on the adaptive online policies of Kleinberg
  and Weinberg and Feldman et al. for the intersection of two matroids in two ways:
  our policy is nonadaptive and has a better approximation guarantee of 3 instead
  of the previous guarantees of 5.82 in Kleinberg and Weinberg and 5.43 in Feldman
  et al. We give a complementary lower bound of 2.25 for any online algorithm in the
  bipartite matching setting.  Funding: This work was supported by Fundamental Research
