abstract: We study fair resource allocation when the resources contain a mixture of
  divisible and indivisible goods, focusing on the well-studied fairness notion of
  maximin share fairness (MMS). With only indivisible goods, a full MMS allocation
  may not exist, but a constant multiplicative approximate allocation always does.
  We analyze how the MMS approximation guarantee would be affected when the resources
  to be allocated also contain divisible goods. In particular, we show that the worst-case
  MMS approximation guarantee with mixed goods is no worse than that with only indivisible
  goods. However, there exist problem instances to which adding some divisible resources
  would strictly decrease the MMS approximation ratios of the instances. On the algorithmic
  front, we propose a constructive algorithm that will always produce an $$alpha$$-MMS
  allocation for any number of agents, where $$alpha$$takes values between 1/2 and
  1 and is a monotonically increasing function determined by how agents value the
  divisible goods relative to their MMS values.
