abstract: Selecting a subset of candidates with various attributes under fairness
  constraints has been attracting considerable attention from the AI community, with
  applications ranging from school admissions to committee selections. The fairness
  constraints are usually captured by absolute upper bounds and/or lower bounds on
  the number of selected candidates in specific attributes. In many scenarios, however,
  the total number of selected candidates is not predetermined. It is, therefore,
  more natural to express these fairness constraints in terms of proportions of the
  final selection size. In this paper, we study the proportional candidate selection
  problem, where the goal is to select a subset of candidates with maximum cardinality
  while meeting certain proportional fairness constraints. We first analyze the computational
  complexity of the problem and show strong inapproximability results. Next, we investigate
  the algorithmic aspects of the problem in two directions. First, by treating the
  proportional fairness constraints as soft constraints, we devise two polynomial-time
  algorithms that could return (near) optimal solutions with bounded violations on
  each fairness constraint. Second, we design an exact algorithm with a fast running
  time in practice. Simulations based on both synthetic and publicly available data
  confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms.
