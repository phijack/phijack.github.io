# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research interests include sublinear algorithm on big data and related statistics and also learning theory, especially learnablity problems. I also did some works on Algorithmic Mechanism Design, Fair Division and Online Algorithm, which I think I will keep working on. I am also have a broad interests in Theoretical Computer Science.

# About me
Hongao is a PhD student at Purdue University since 2021 fall and I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Paul Valiant](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/pvaliant/) and [Prof. Steve Hanneke](https://stevehanneke.com/).

I was a project officer at Nanyang Technological University, which is a position similar to the research assistant in US. It is my honor to be supervised by Prof. Xiaohui Bei at NTU, Singapore. Before that, I was an undergraduate at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and did several research projects with Prof. Gravin and Prof. Lu from Shanghai University of Finance and Economics.

My research interests include Algorithmic Mechanism Design, Fair Division, Online Algorithm, sublinear algorithm on big data and related statistics and learnability problem on online learning. I am now focusing more on statistics related algorithms and learning theory, even though I did some works on mechanism design and fair division, which I will try to keep working on. I also have broad interests in Theoretical Computer Science.
