# About me
My name is Hongao Wang (王弘奥). I am a PhD student at Purdue University since 2021 fall and I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Paul Valiant](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/pvaliant/) and [Prof. Steve Hanneke](https://stevehanneke.com/).

I was a project officer at Nanyang Technological University, which is a position similar to the research assistant in US. It is my honor to be supervised by [Prof. Xiaohui Bei](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/xhbei/) at NTU, Singapore. Before that, I was an undergraduate at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and did several research projects with [Prof. Nick Gravin](https://ngravin.github.io/) from Shanghai University of Finance and Economics.

My research interests include Algorithmic Mechanism Design, Fair Division, Online Algorithm, sublinear algorithm on big data and related statistics and learnability problem on online learning. I am now focusing more on statistics related algorithms and learning theory, even though I did some works on mechanism design and fair division, which I will try to keep working on. I also have broad interests in Theoretical Computer Science.
