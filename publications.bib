abstract = {Selecting a subset of candidates with various attributes under fairness constraints has been attracting considerable attention from the AI community, with applications ranging from school admissions to committee selections. The fairness constraints are usually captured by absolute upper bounds and/or lower bounds on the number of selected candidates in specific attributes. In many scenarios, however, the total number of selected candidates is not predetermined. It is, therefore, more natural to express these fairness constraints in terms of proportions of the final selection size. In this paper, we study the proportional candidate selection problem, where the goal is to select a subset of candidates with maximum cardinality while meeting certain proportional fairness constraints. We first analyze the computational complexity of the problem and show strong inapproximability results. Next, we investigate the algorithmic aspects of the problem in two directions. First, by treating the proportional fairness constraints as soft constraints, we devise two polynomial-time algorithms that could return (near) optimal solutions with bounded violations on each fairness constraint. Second, we design an exact algorithm with a fast running time in practice. Simulations based on both synthetic and publicly available data confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms.},

  abstract = {We study fair resource allocation when the resources contain a mixture of divisible and indivisible goods, focusing on the well-studied fairness notion of maximin share fairness (MMS). With only indivisible goods, a full MMS allocation may not exist, but a constant multiplicative approximate allocation always does. We analyze how the MMS approximation guarantee would be affected when the resources to be allocated also contain divisible goods. In particular, we show that the worst-case MMS approximation guarantee with mixed goods is no worse than that with only indivisible goods. However, there exist problem instances to which adding some divisible resources would strictly decrease the MMS approximation ratios of the instances. On the algorithmic front, we propose a constructive algorithm that will always produce an \$\${\textbackslash}alpha\$\$-MMS allocation for any number of agents, where \$\${\textbackslash}alpha\$\$takes values between 1/2 and 1 and is a monotonically increasing function determined by how agents value the divisible goods relative to their MMS values.},

  abstract = {We consider the Bayesian online selection problem of a matching in bipartite graphs, that is, the weighted online matching problem where the edges arrive online and edge weights are generated from a known distribution. This setting corresponds to the intersection of two matroids in the work of Kleinberg and Weinberg [ 40 ] and Feldman et al. [ 27 ]. We study a simple class of nonadaptive policies that we call vertex-additive policies. A vertex-additive policy assigns static prices to every vertex in the graph and accepts only those edges whose weight exceeds the sum of the prices on the edge endpoints. We show that there exists a vertex-additive policy with the expected payoff of at least one-third of the prophet's payoff and present a gradient descent algorithm that quickly converges to the desired vector of vertex prices. Our results improve on the adaptive online policies of Kleinberg and Weinberg and Feldman et al. for the intersection of two matroids in two ways: our policy is nonadaptive and has a better approximation guarantee of 3 instead of the previous guarantees of 5.82 in Kleinberg and Weinberg and 5.43 in Feldman et al. We give a complementary lower bound of 2.25 for any online algorithm in the bipartite matching setting.
